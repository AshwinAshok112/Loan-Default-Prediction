# Loan-Default-Prediction
## Overview
A Bank accepts deposits from customers and from the corpus thus available, it lends to borrowers who want to carry out certain business activities for growth and profit. 
It is often seen that due to some reasons like failure of business, huge financial losses or the company becoming delinquent/bankrupt, the loans are not Paid in Full. 
The bank then has to either Charge-Off/Write Off the loan or have to seek other measures to retrieve their due payment. Increased Non-Performing Assets(NPAs) for the bank
severely affects the health of the bank, even threatening the national economy. The bank is thus faced with the problem of identifying those borrowers who can pay up their 
due amount, and not lending to borrowers who are likely to default.
